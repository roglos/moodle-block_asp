ASP BLOCK

This block was created for the Open Unversity (https://www.open.ac.uk/) by
LUNS (http://www.luns.net.uk/services/virtual-learning-environments/vle-services/).
The specification was writted by Tim Hunt and Sharon Monie.

You can install this block from the Moodle plugins database:
http://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=block_asp

Alternatively, you can install it using git. Type this command in the top level
of your Moodle install:
    git clone git://github.com/moodleou/moodle-block_asp.git blocks/asp

Once you have added the code to Moodle, visit the admin notifications page to
complete the installation.

If you are using this plugin, then you probably also want to install the asp report:
